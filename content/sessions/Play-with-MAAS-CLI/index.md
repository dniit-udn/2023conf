MAAS (Metal as a Service) https://maas.io/ is an open-source tool that lets you create a data centre from bare-metal servers.

With MAAS, you can automate server provisioning and installing OS remotely on both physical and virtual servers. 

MAAS has a GUI for provisioning and configuring the server, but if we configure the server with a huge number, it will become a problem because it takes time to use GUI. In this talk, I will introduce the MAAS CLI tools that can be used to automate everything.

## Prior knowledge
Linux and Networking basic
