Have you tried Ubuntu on Raspberry Pi? Raspberry Pi is now standard 'Single Board Computer' works with several OSes. It is cheap and easy to handle - IoT devices and server evaluation. 
In this workshop, Masafumi focus on Ubuntu Server on Raspberry Pi, especially k8s+container on 8GB Raspberry Pi 4B; Masafumi will instruct how to build the container environment with microk8s - a lightweight k8s to understand k8s easily:
 - Install the Ubuntu environment
 - Install container environment
 - Install microk8s
 - Try container cluster with microk8s
   - Suppose the k8s web server cluster 
      - Ingress setting
      - replica set setting to auto-scaling
      - external routing
      - issues on the server Certificate

## Prior knowledge
Container environment knowledges: What container is and What kubernetes is

## What participants need to prepare for your workshop 
Bring your Laptop to make Ubuntu OS media with Etcher or Raspberry Pi imager and control Raspberry Pi from your PC.

## What audience can learn from this session
Attendess will expect how to use Raspberry Pi on Ubuntu and how to try container environment on Raspberry Pi

## About the speaker
Masafumi is leading Raspberry Pi community in Japan and helping Raspberry Pi business/community in Asian area - not only Japan but also Taiwan/China/Korea and more.
